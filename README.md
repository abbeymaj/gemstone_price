## Gemstone Price Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the price of gemstones, given certain attributes of the gemstone. A company would use this prediction to distinguish between higher profitable stones from lower profitable stones. Thus, this is a typical regression machine learning problem.

There are 10 independent variables (including id):

1. id : unique identifier of each diamond
2. carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones.
3. cut : Quality of the gemstone's Cut
4. color : Color of the gemstone.
5. clarity : The gemstone's clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
6. depth : The depth of the gemstone is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
table : A gemston's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
7. x : The gemstone's X dimension
8. y : The gemstone's Y dimension
9. x : The gemstone's Z dimension
10. Price : Price of the gemstone.

"Price" is the target variable for this project.
